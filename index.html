    <h1>CS 184 Final Report: It's Corona Time</h1>
    <h2>Abstract</h2>
    <p>Our project is called “It’s Corona Time.” It’s a VR game that you can play on your phone without a headset or VR
        platform. In this game, you are a human floating in the sky, as if you’re on your way to heaven. With the
        directional light above, behind you looks like hell. You’re in the middle, and coronavirus heads towards you.
        It’s your job to shoot down the enemies. The special bullet you have has the ability to instantly kill a virus
        and even possibly bounce to another based on your angle of attack. Keep fighting the randomly spawned viruses
        that spawn faster and faster!
    </p>
    <h2>Technical Approach</h2>
    <h3>Summary of Technical Approach (and Problems Encountered)</h3>
    <p>We faced a lot of problems in our project. The first was not really knowing how to use Unity and Maya. In Unity,
        we had to look up a lot of video tutorials about basic functionality. The video we started out with was <a
            href="https://youtu.be/Ml2UakwRxjk">this</a>. It
        was really similar to what we wanted, but after adding in the basic ARKit, it stopped helping.</p>
    <p>So, the first main problem was learning what a screen was as well as how to create objects. Instead of starting
        at Unity, we knew we wanted to create our own models. So, we went to Maya. Maya itself is another beast.</p>
    <p>We watched most of the videos in the Maya 101 playlist on the official Maya Learning Channel on YouTube. We
        learned how to navigate around the 3D space and what important windows like the outliner, channel box, and
        attribute editor were.</p>
    <p>In Maya, we first got to create basic cylinders. That wasn’t bad. However, when we tried to make it smaller, it
        was hard. Constantly putting multiple smaller cylinders to represent the sides getting smaller was a bad idea
        (the needle getting sharper). So, we looked up something and we got the result “extrude.” This thing saved our
        lives.</p>
    <p>Extrude was weird because it wouldn’t look like anything would happen in the beginning, but it actually creates
        another set of vertices/faces from the face that we extruded. If we had a plane, we can extrude another exact
        plane and then extend that upward to make a square into a cube. With this, we were able to take the top of a
        cylinder and extend it outwards, then make the radius smaller. This was a way to sharpen a cylinder closer to a
        cone or to make thicker areas of the syringe.</p>
    <p>We also had some smoothing problems. Although the models looked smoothed in Maya, when we imported to Unity, the
        models looked rougher. We found out that Unity does not support Maya’s smooth preview mode (when you press “3”
        in Maya and it looks smoother), so we had to do an actual geometry smoothing in Maya.</p>
    <p>After getting the model, we imported it to Unity. Transfering the models from Maya to Unity was a big hassle.
        First, we discovered that textures don’t transfer over, so we had to figure out how to attack texture in Unity.
        Also, we discovered that Unity does not have any UV unwrapping features, so we had to make multiple trips back
        to Maya to set the UV maps of several models.</p>
    <p>In Unity, a big problem was dealing with scripts. We knew nothing about C#, and that led to figuring out
        how Unity also did its script., The first script we created was the script from the starting video for AR. To
        fix that, we added a white plane so that anywhere you looked became white. This became VR because we don’t need
        the surrounding image. Instead, we use it to adjust where you are looking. In that script, we used the ARKit
        given and shot a ray. Whatever the ray hit would be stored in a variable called <code>RaycastHit</code>. In this
        variable, we were given the GameObject we hit, which gives us the tag (“Player”, ”virus”, ”syringe”),
        coordinates, and the normal of that surface.</p>
    <p>However, we found out we don’t want to send out a syringe only when we tap on a virus. Instead of only shooting
        something when we tap on a virus, we want to shoot whenever the player taps somewhere on the screen. So, instead
        of using <code>RaycastHit</code>, we simply just shoot out the syringe and deal with the collision effects
        later.</p>
    <p>This leads us to the next script, which is the syringe behaviour. The first thing we needed to do was be able to
        notice where we hit and add a force or move it in a certain direction. However, it seemed to us that we needed
        some physics, so we included a RigidBody. With that, we were able to add forces to the RigidBody and change the
        direction of the syringe. Here, we found the reflective ray because anytime we enter a collision, we are able to
        obtain the collision point as well as the collision normal at the surface we hit. We used the equation
        <code>R = L - 2 * dot(N, L) * N</code> with a normalized N.</p>
    <p>We realized we never spawned the bullet yet. This took us a long time because we didn’t know what a prefab was.
        Simply creating an object and then adding it onto the object to shoot doesn’t work. We had to put it into a
        prefab and then add the prefab into the object to shoot. So, when we shoot, we grab the “forward” direction of
        where we are looking based on the original ray from the ARKit. With this, we know the direction to shoot the
        object and we simply added an arbitrary amount of force, about 20 units. Again, because we added different
        aspects to our in-game object, we never updated our prefab. So when we tried to spawn a bullet, it didn’t have
        the new effects, such as bouncing or different speeds.</p>
    <p>There is also a script to make the human body follow the camera. This is tricky because the human body needs to
        follow the camera’s position. However, it only needs to follow the camera’s rotation about the vertical axis so
        that when you look down you can see the body. To implement this, a script constantly updates the body as
        follows: 1) move the body so that it was the same distance as it was from the camera in the previous frame. 2)
        get the point direction of the camera and project this vector onto a plane parallel to the ground. Point the
        body this way.</p>
    <p>Lastly, we needed to make sure the virus spawned and slowly moved towards the player. In order to make the virus
        spawn randomly near the player, we wrote a script that generates a random location for where we wanted the virus
        to spawn and instantiates a new virus at that specific location. At first, we weren’t really sure how to
        instantiate a new virus, but after a couple Google searches we found out that there was a built-in function
        `Instantiate()` that creates new GameObjects (i.e. our viruses). In order to make the virus move towards the
        player over time, we wrote a script that calculates the distance between the virus and the player every frame,
        and if the distance was ever over a certain limit, the function would move the virus at a certain speed closer
        towards the player.</p>
    <p>To make the game more appealing, we also changed the background to not white. To do this, we added a sphere and
        put the players and the viruses inside. However, whenever we added a texture or image on top of it, it would
        only show outside the sphere, the inside was an empty grey color. So, we looked into what we should do, and we
        figured out that the color is because of the surface normals. If we inverted it, then we would be able to see
        the image from the inside! It worked!</p>
    <p>Unity does not support monocular mobile VR by default. The closest thing it has is Google Daydream and
        Cardboard, which splits the phone screen in half (binocular VR). This is useless if you don’t have the proper
        headwear. To implement monocular VR, we used Unity’s ARKit and ARCore features. This is the main tutorial we
        used: <a
            href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ml2UakwRxjk&t=712s">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ml2UakwRxjk&t=712s</a>.
        AR games are always monocular. To create monocular
        mobile VR, we told Unity to run and build itself like an AR game. However, for all the pixels displaying real
        world imagery, replace those pixels with a texture image of a sunset.</p>
    <h3>Lessons Learned</h3>
    <p>Teamwork is important. We ran into some git push and pull issues early on. We learned to communicate who is
        working on what at all times and not do overlapping work.</p>
